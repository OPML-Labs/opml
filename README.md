# OPML: OPtimistic Machine Learning on Blockchain

OPML enables off-chain AI model inference using optimistic approach with an on chain interactive dispute engine implementing fault proofs.

For more in-depth information, refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/hyperoracle/opml/wiki).

You can also find a tutorial on building a straightforward handwritten digit recognition DNN model (MNIST) within OPML in the [`docs/tutorial.md`](docs/tutorial.md).

## Building

Pre-requisites: Go (Go 1.19), Node.js, Make, and CMake.

```
git clone git@github.com:hyperoracle/opml.git --recursive
make build
```

## Project Structure

```
mlgo -- A tensor library for machine learning in pure Golang that can run on MIPS.
mlvm -- A MIPS runtime with ML execution
contracts -- A Merkleized MIPS processor on chain + the challenge logic
```

## Examples

### MNIST

The script files [`demo/challenge_simple.sh`](demo/challenge_simple.sh) presents an example scenario (a DNN model for MNIST) demonstrating the whole process of a fault proof, including the challenge game and single step verification.

To test the example, we should first start a local node:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

Then we can run:

```shell
sh ./demo/challenge_simple.sh
```

A large language model, the llama example is provided in the branch ["llama"](https://github.com/hyperoracle/opml/tree/llama) (It also works for llama 2).



### LLaMA

**Note**: This part is still under development!

We can support LLaMA 1 and LLaMA 2 (7B and 13B). 
Before testing LLaMA, please refer to `mlgo/examples/llama/README.md` and download the model of LLaMA.

After that, we can first start a local node
```shell
npx hardhat node
```
Then we can run 
```shell
sh ./demo/challenge_llama.sh
```

Note: when running `sh ./demo/challenge_llama.sh`, you may encounter such an error in console "SocketError: other side closed". Just ignore it. :) This is a special "feature" of hardhat when running the JS script that takes too long time. I have fixed it in the script. Although you can see an error in console, the script should run correctly.
